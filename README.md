# NARGA Core

NARGA Core is a WordPress theme development library for creating solid parent themes. It allows theme developers to forget about all the complex functionality and dive straight into coding their theme’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```
The NARGA Core library is not a WordPress theme. You cannot install it into WordPress and expect it to work. It is a development framework for building custom themes. If you’re looking for a theme that you install, head on over to the themes page.
```
